## things I learned today

### html and CSS 

Wow! This is my *second* markdown file! 

I'm impressed with myself for **tryng to learn how to use these applications independently! Today I also learned about html and made a projects folder for it on my desktop. I still am not super tech savy but I asked Professor Schacht to clarify some of the steps for me. This class has taught me so much but sometimes it is confusing to me because the information is out of my comfort zone. We had a very interesting talk focused on the podcast that we listened to for homework the other day. I found this podcast super interesting. It also made me realize how many scary things are on the internet that I am not aware of. I will try to be more concious of who can see my posts.**
