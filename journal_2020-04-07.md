today is april 7, 2020! 

i created a timeline today using google sheets. the website had a template that was premade so that was very helpful! 

I am struggling to add a picture to my journal. I looked up what I did in my original journal with the wiki picture but i dont think it worked :/

i really enjoyed making the timeline once i figured out how to add pictures. I tried to add videos too but it didnt work
