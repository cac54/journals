hello 

okay so round three! my computer is being quite difficult and is not correctly saving my files. In all honesty, I think I am just incorrectly saving them. Sooooo I hope this works! 

Christina sent me some very helpful directions that I will need for the future: Thanks Christina! 

Here’s the steps to upload to github:

1. Use “cd” to get wherever your journal folder is. So I do “cd Documents” then “cd journal”. 
2. Once in your journal folder, type “git status”.
This should show the files you haven’t uploaded yet to git
3. Type: add file journal*
This will add all journal files without you having to add them individually 
4. Type: git commit -m “description”
The description can be whatever you want
5. Type: git push origin master 


I enjoyed reading Walden a lot this week- it was a nice break from all the craziness around me. 

Stay safe and healthy!
