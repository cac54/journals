## things I learned today

### html on the web  

Wow! This is my *fourth* markdown file! 

I'm impressed with myself for **learning more about html files. Today in class, I actually uploaded my html file to google drive. This put MY file on the web! How exciting!! I am excited to explore this more and hopefully add a gif to my file along with a funny dog picture. Update: I added gifs and it was complicated. Make sure you add quotation marks for all pics and gifs. We can add margins and colors to change text and put it in a certain location. Fonts like Arial, Helvetica, and sans are available to customize your html files. You can also change the background. Today I was introduced to command line. This is a document open to everyone on the web and I can also find it on the syllabus. When using the command line, you're going through the GUI (you just see text, no icons). You need to type things exactly as they are. Do not type any command that requires you to type the word he said not to type (not even typing it here lol). Open terminal. type whoami to find out what user you are. ls opens different  document types. cd is a command. EDIT EDIT EDIT**

I'm on my to becoming a [digital humanist]
