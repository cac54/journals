today is april 2, 2020! 

Because of the corona virus, I have not been able to leave my house except to walk my dog and go to the grocery store. My family and I are trying to only get the stuff we absolutely need and are not stocking up so everyone else can get what they need also. We have been very creative with our meals and are trying to utalize the resources we have. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy!
