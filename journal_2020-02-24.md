## learning more about github

I have to commit something before I upload it again. In Git, a commit is a snapshot of a repository that is entered into its permanent history. To commit a change to a repository, we take two steps: (1) Adding files to a "staging area," meaning that we intend to commit them. (2) Finalizing the commit. You can drag anything into the terminal and find the path it takes to get there. A useful keyboard command in terminal is control a. it moves your cursor back to the beginning of the line. control e moves your cursor to the end of the line. the more you utalize the commands, the more they will stick.
