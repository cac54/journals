## my 18th journal file

### online classes

Wow! This is *my 18th* markdown file! 

I'm impressed with myself for **finishing my last day of classes!**

Working on my final project online has not been as difficult as I thought. I am very impressed by how flexible and accomodating my group members are! Our zoom calls are very productive and I feel lucky to have such a great group!
