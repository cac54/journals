today is april 1, 2020! 

the corona virus is still a thing :(
    It keeps escalating which is very sad 

    the modules on canvas that we do for 340 are very interesting! I enjoyed the emily dickinson one a lot.

I miss geneseo and real classes. Online classes have been okay but its so much easier being at school.

Stay healty and safe! -Caroline
