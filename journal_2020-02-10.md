## things I learned today

### making a walden account online

Wow! This is my *third* markdown file! yay! 

I'm impressed with myself for **understanding the steps in class and not falling behind. I made my walden account and successfully can view and comment when I need to! Here are some more important notees: finder is the key to everything. This is generically called GUI (graphical user interface). This makes it easy to interact with the content of your computer. It makes it easier to visualize what is on your laptop. This semester, we will learn how to use our computers without the GUI. There is a value to your GUI showing you the heirarchical elaborate system on top of your hard drive and user (and etc). Another word for folders is directories. Every file on your computer basically has a postal address. This address starts with /Users/yourusername/path/to/some/file. In browser, you can get to anyfile by doing file:///Users/yourusername/path/to/some/file... This does not work with Safari super well so... USE CHROME! http://somedomain.org/path/to/page is also helpful to know and have written down. Things like .html, .docx, .txt, .pdf, and more are called file extentions. These are helpful because they identifty what type of file they are and what extention you may need to use in the future. pdf stands for portable doctument format. Txt is plain text. .md stands for markdown. Why is plain text important? Plain text is easier to open across a wide platform. You can open them on basically any type of software. They take up less space (they are usually just a KB each). They are also easily transformable. Additionally, they are easily accessable. Mardown is a varient of markup. Markup is a simplified and symbolic format for plain text. John Greuber invented this and there is a guide to the syntax on the syllabus (dh. website). Markup is a language for describing content in a text file, maily for the purpose of presentation on the web. Markdown is the simpliedied symbolic formatting for plain text. <p> is paragraph </p> and <img src= "path/ to file.jpg" /> and <h1> heading one 1</h1? > same for heading two but replace 1 with two. <a href="http:geneseo.edu">Geneseo</a> . order matters.  CSS is cascading style sheets. This is a language for assigning styling to markup. This allows you to customize your document more.**

Git allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project. You can also store the files that you create in repositories on the website. 

Today I also tested opening git hub in terminal. This is what it looked like:
