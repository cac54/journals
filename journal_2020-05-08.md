## my 20th journal file

### online classes

Wow! This is *my 20th* markdown file! 

I'm impressed with myself for **learning online**

My group and I have finished out TEI file and are almost done with the timeline. The blog post is also coming along nicely. I am so happy that this project has not been super stressful-especially since we are all doing this remotely!
