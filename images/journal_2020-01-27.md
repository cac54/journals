journal for the week of march 26.

Hello! the two journals that I wrote for this week are lost somewhere on my computer so this is a new one! 

I am struggling to upload my files to github right now but (thanks Christina) for sending me some helpful directions!!!

I really miss geneseo and hope that everyone is staying safe. 

Today, I went to the grocery store and people were lined up for hundreds of feet just to get into the store. This is such a hectic and scary time. 

I also learned today that someone in geneseo has the corona virus. I hope that they are okay and that this virus does not carry out into the summer. 

Stay safe everyone and practice social distancing!!!
